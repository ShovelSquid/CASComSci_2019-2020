This app relies a lot on location tracking data and most likely bluetooth to determine the locations of nearby people. If someone is
carrying a phone, a smart watch, airpods, any sort of technology with tracking capabilities, they should be used to determine where
they are in the physical world. The app warns the user when another person enters close range, such as 8 to 10 feet, so being able
to track where other people are is important and may prove to be difficult.

Tracking people who are not carrying any sort of technology would be quite difficult, and would most likely go undetected.
Perhaps some sort of AR technology could be implemented to detect humans, regardless of if they had a phone on them or not. Nonetheless,
this poses a challenge and a risk.

Location tracking data for the user should be quite simple, determining whether or not they are inside or outside via their location.
