A person taking a stroll should be able to run away after hearing a loud noise emanating from their phone.
This loud noise is caused by other people coming within close contact of the user.
The loud noise does not have to be a loud beeping noise, the app will utilize fun(ish) voice-overs in order to incentivize 
the user to run away with alarming speed.
Voice overs may include:
  - Infected Detected! Run away!
  - Its too late for me, save yourself!
  - I always wanted you to know... you need to wash your hands!
Things of that caliber.
The app itself does not really have any functions, it is however always on and always monitoring for other people.
The app does not need to be open in order for the VO to play, however notifications must be enabled.
The app itself would only be used for configuration and nice tips for surviving quarantine. There would be a settings modifier to change
the voice overs, notifications and other various settings. The other feature in the actual app screen itself would be a button that says,
"Tips" or something that would give nice tips and things to remember during the infestation. Things such as:
  - Always remember to wash your hands
  - ___ is a really great game/book/movie to check out instead of heading outside!
  - Toilet paper is not a commodity that you need to stock up on.
The app should not be able to have access to the other human's personal data, so they would have no idea whether or not the person coming
within breathing range would be infected or not. As such, the app will always tell you to run whenever another human enters the vicinity,
regardless of whether or not they are infected.
- The app should also warn you whenever you are outside, using location tracking data to tell when you have left your home. It will then 
say things like, "Warning, leaving safe zone" and things such as that.
