A person taking a stroll should be able to run away after hearing a loud noise emanating from their phone.
This loud noise is caused by other people coming within close contact of the user.
The loud noise does not have to be a loud beeping noise, the app will utilize fun(ish) voice-overs in order to incentivize 
the user to run away with alarming speed.
Voice overs may include:
  - Infected Detected! Run away!
  - Its too late for me, save yourself!
  - I always wanted you to know... you need to wash your hands!
Things of that caliber.
The app itself does not really have any functions, it is however always on and always monitoring for other people.
The app does not need to be open in order for the VO to play, however notifications must be enabled.
The app itself would only be used for configuration, however there may be a big button in the center that says, "RUN" and it will then play
the normal response to a human entering close quarters.
The app should not be able to have access to the other human's personal data, so they would have no idea whether or not the person coming
within breathing range would be infected or not. As such, the app will always tell you to run whenever another human enters the vicinity.
