What is this app?
- ideally, it is a character creator. You can see a list of all your created characters, see their stats, edit them, level them up, 
add new characters and delete others. 

Is anything broken?
- yes.

What is broken?
- most of everything. Loading the characters doesn't work properly; it just returns an empty list. 
- Saving doesn't seem to work properly either
- Since loading returns a list of empty characters, no characters are displayed. That means that you cannot tap any to view their stats.
If there were any in there with actual stats, that works. Howevers, there aren't any in there right now.
- Before, whenever I tried to make a new character the program would crash and I would get a SIGABRT. This scared me so I foolishly
decided to create a new app. This did not proceed very far, the program wouldn't recognize the character class I had defined and treated
it like a string. So I then returned back to this program.

This has been a learning experience.
